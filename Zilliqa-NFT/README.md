## ZRC-6

ZRC-6 is Zilliqa’s new NFT standard, which introduces several additional features on top of the previous ZRC-1 standard. Some new features of ZRC-6 NFTs include the ability for creators to implement royalty fees to their tokens, the ability to pause NFT smart contracts, 
and the ability to execute batch operations like minting and burning. Let’s read the article below to find out more about ZRC-6.

ZRC-6 introduces royalty payment solutions to allow creators to earn royalties when their NFTs are resold in the market

ZRC-6 standardises token URI by combining the base token URI with token ID. We will explain what these terms mean later in the quest

ZRC-6 introduces remote state read, which optimises the ability for smart contracts to read another contract’s mutable variables by reducing the complexity of the smart contract logic and gas consumption

ZRC-6 allows NFT creators to pause/unpause their NFT smart contract. When the contract is paused, minting, burning and token transfers will not be permitted

ZRC-6 adds batch operations for minting, burning and token transfer, improving the user experience in the Zilliqa ecosystem and help provide gas savings for the user
